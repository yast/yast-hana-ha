<h3>SAP HANA System Replication Scale Up: Cost-Optimized in Microsoft&reg; Azure&reg;</h3>

<p>Please note: The Azure and SAP HANA setup needs to be done by the user upfront. This wizard configures SBD fencing, and therefore it requires that iSCSI is also configured.</p>
<p>This wizard will only take care of the cluster and  HANA system replication configuration. For more information, please visit the link below:</p>

<p>This programm will guide you through a cluster installation and configuration in Microsoft Azure environment. For further help and documentation, please visit the pages below:</p>

</ul>

<p>Before proceeding with the installation, please make sure of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        There are two machines with SAP HANA installed.
        <br/> Note that the machine you run the wizard on becomes the primary node in the cluster.
    </li>
    <li>Verify that both databases are up and running.</li>
    <li>
        The master node SSH public key is authorized for SSH access to the secondary node. This is needed when SSH password access is disabled, which is the default on Microsoft Azure.
    </li>
    <li>
        The package yast2-sap-ha must be installed on all nodes before this module is executed. It is not installed by default on Microsoft Azure.
    </li>
    <li>
        You have created one of the following:
        <ul type="square">
            <li>
                A key in the HANA Secure User Store (using the <code>hdbuserstore</code> utility) on the primary HANA node. </br> If you are configuring a multi-tenant HANA installation (default for HANA versions 2.0 SPS01 and above), please make sure that the secure store key is properly configured for connecting to the <code>SystemDB</code>, i.e., specify port <code>3&lt;SID&gt;13</code> in the environment settings and <code>SystemDB</code> as the target database.
            </li>
            <li>
                An initial HANA backup (of the <code>SystemDB</code> and all tenant databases, in an MDC setup) on the primary HANA node.
                Please note that if you prefer to perform backup manually on HANA 2.0, you should also make sure that the SSFS keys are the same on both HANA nodes.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The second node has to have a secondary, non-production HANA instance installed, <i>but not running</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        You've created a HANA Secure User Store key <code>QASSAPDBCTRL</code> for monitoring purposes (please refer to the <i>SUSE SAP HANA SR Cost Optimized Scenario</i> best practice guide, section 4.2.7).
    </li>
</ul>
