    <h2>Communication Layer</h2>
    <p>This step configures the cluster's communication layer.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Transport mode</b> defines the transport mode of the corosync messaging layer.
        Unicast (default) is preferred in most of the configurations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Number of rings</b>. This parameter allows you to set more than one communication ring
        for redundancy.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every ring a binding address and a port should be specified.
        If you use Multicast transport mode, one multicast address has to be 
        provided per each ring.
    </p>
    <p><b>Cluster name</b> is the internal name of the cluster.</p>

    <p>This dialog allows you to control the number of nodes in the cluster and their respective IP addresses.<br/>
    Please make sure that the provided IP addresses correspond to the network addresses of the rings.</p>
    <p><i>Note:</i> the number of nodes for HANA scale-up clusters is fixed and cannot be changed.</p>

    <p>There are 3 possibility for the <b>Firewall configuration</b>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Firewall is configured</b> The firewall on all nodes is already configured. All necessary ports for cluster and SAP HANA are opened. In this case only port 8080 will be temporary opened on the slave node during the setup</li>
      <li><b>Turn off Firewall</b> The firewall will be turned of on all nodes during the setup.</li>
      <li><b>Configure Firewall</b> The firewall will be configured by using HANA-firewall and by enabling the cluster service.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Enable Corosync Secure Authentication</b>:
    require the HMAC/SHA1 authentication for cluster messages authentication.
    This option reduces total throughput of the cluster messaging level and consumes extra CPU cycles for encryption.
    </p>

    <p><b>Enable csync2</b>: enable the <code>csync2</code> service that synchronizes cluster-related configuration files between nodes.</p>
