<h2>Watchdog Configuration</h2>
<p>A watchdog device is required to be loaded in order for the SBD to work correctly.</p>
<p>If your hardware or virtualization platform does not offer a watchdog, make sure that you at least configure the software watchdog, "softdog", module.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Watchdogs to Configure</dt>
    <dd>is a list of watchdog modules to be configured to load at the system boot (by listing them in <code>/etc/modules-load.d/yast.conf</code>).</dd>
<dt>Configured Watchdogs</dt>
    <dd>shows a list of watchdog already added to <code>/etc/modules-load.d/yast.conf</code>).</dd>
<dt>Loaded watchdogs</dt>
    <dd>shows a list of already loaded kernel modules.</dd>
</dl>
<p>During the configuration phase all the modules listed in the <b>Watchdogs to Configure</b> will be added to the configuration file <b>and</b> probed immediately.</p>
